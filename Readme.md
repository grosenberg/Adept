# Adept

A universal code formatter implemented using machine learning of aesthetic preferences. 
Includes a dedicated comment formatter that supports C/Java style block and line 
comment syntax, including formal JavaDoc. 

The Adept tool is designed for both stand-alone (CLI) and embedded use.

A suite of visualization tools serve as development aids as well as examples of embedded 
use. The `FormatView` visualization tool provides the most complete demonstration 
of use.
